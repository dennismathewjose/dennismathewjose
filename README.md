Hello Everyone!!
I’m Dennis Mathew Jose, a smart-working B.Tech Electronics and Communication graduate (2019-2023) with a strong interest in Data Science and Analytics. 

Worked as Associate Consultant at Oracle Financial Services Software Limited(2023-2024). During my time there, I was an integral part of the project team, working with a robust tech stack that included JAVA, SQL, and backend technologies, and specializing in Oracle Banking Product modules such as Flexcube and OBPM. My responsibilities encompassed a range of critical tasks, including analyzing situations and data to deliver high-quality work products that provided functional and technical solutions for Oracle applications and technology installations. I collaborated with team members and clients to ensure that the solutions provided were effective and aligned with the client's needs.

In addition to my professional experience, I have been actively involved in volunteering activities. I served as the Chairperson of IEEE SB GEC Thrissur from 2022 to 2023 and as the LINK Representative from 2021 to 2022. I have also mentored workshops on Python programming for students, Ideator, and IEEE. These activities have helped me enhance my managerial and organizational skills and taught me how to work and thrive under pressure.

Besides my professional and volunteering endeavours, I love watching movies, listening to music, and solving sudoku puzzles during my free time.Hello Everyone!!
